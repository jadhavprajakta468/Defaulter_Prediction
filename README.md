# Defaulter_Prediction
This project aims to develop an efficient system for predicting student defaulters based on their attendance records. By analyzing attendance patterns, we seek to forecast whether a student is likely to default on academic obligations.

Project focuses on developing a predictive system to identify student defaulters based on their attendance records using supervised learning techniques, specifically employing the Random Forest classification model. The dataset provided is in CSV format, containing labels denoted as YES or NO, indicating whether a student is likely to
default.The core aim of our project is to provide educators with a tool that can predict student defaulters for any given month by analyzing their attendance data. By inputting the attendance for the upcoming month, our system generates predictions for all students, aiding teachers in proactive intervention and support.
